PROJECT ASSESSMENT

1. SCOPE

The project scope was initiated from the beginning of the project. For instance, the system aims to contibute in the medical field to help reduce burdens of healthcare workers and to curb the pandemic with accurate infromations.


2. OBJECTIVES

JAAZ Sdn.Bhd was able to meet the goals set out at the start of the project. 
JAAZ Sdn Bhd managed to create a conversational Ai technology that has been deployed on Telegram server and users can ask queries, FAQ's, announcements at anytime and anywhere.

3. IMPACTS

This can help reduce burden of healthcare workers, provide only accurate infromations to the users and provide fast infromation to users.
This is extremely crucial in the midst of a pandemic.

4. TRANSITION PLAN

JAAZ Sdn Bhd will strive to do better when needed. As of now the system can handle queries and return outputs based on intent matching as well as extracting from  a knowledge base scraped from the WHO website. 
This technology uses NLP (response to users) and ML techniques (Knowledge base becomes richer based on user query)
