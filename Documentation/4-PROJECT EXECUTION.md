3. Inside the intent you may customise many user esperience outputs such as quick replies, adding images and useful hyperlinks.
   Due to space constraint using images as there are many intents which contains parameters and responses, the hardcoding produced by our team in this project under the `intents`    and `entities`, here we have fully customised every intent file in our chatbot to its functionality.
   
4. Create a knowledge base
