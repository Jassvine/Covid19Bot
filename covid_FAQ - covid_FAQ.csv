What is corona virus?,"Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. 

The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.

The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell."
How does COVID-19 spread?,COVID-19 is most likely to spread from person-to-person through: 1.close contact with a person while they are infectious or in the 24 hours before their symptoms appeared 2. Close contact with a person with a confirmed infection who coughs or sneezes 3. Touching objects or surfaces (such as door handles or tables) contaminated from a cough or sneeze from a person with a confirmed infection and then touching your mouth or face.
Can I leave home?,All people are required to stay home unless it is absolutely necessary to go outside.
Should I be tested for COVID-19?,"If you feel any symptoms, please get tested either at a clinic or by the Home Test RTK Kit. Here is a link to purchase the RTK Home Kit for Malaysians : https://www.watsons.com.my/covid-19-rapid-antigen-home-test-kit-1-s/p/BP_39113"
Should I wear a face mask?,"Yes, it is absolutely crucial to wear a mask when surrounded by people and especially outdoors."
Should I be taking my kids out of childcare or school?,Schools and childcare are compeletly closed till furthure order as of now. Online lessons are encouraged.
What about working from home?,Citizens are encouraged to work from home where they can.
What about public transport like planes buses trains ride shares and taxis?,The Government recommends that employers offer flexible working arrangements to minimise the number of people catching public transport at any one time. Long distance services carry a higher risk of infection and should be reconsidered at this time.
What is the government doing to contain the spread of COVID-19?,The government is following the instructions of the WHO carefully and every level of public health machinery is aligned to it. The ministry of health is constantly updated about the numbers of cases and provides instructions to doctors and hospitals regarding the isolation and treatment of patients with the disease. The government has stopped the entry of people from countries affected by this disease by cancelling visas. Those who are suspected of having the disease are being tested. Quarantine facilities have been put into place in multiple locations. Ideally a mechanism for testing anyone who suspects they have the disease should be put in place but this is yet to happen.
Is this infection going to stay or disappear? Will warmer weather help to contain the virus spread? Will it reappear once colder weather returns?,This is particularly hard to predict. Some viral diseases (e.g. flu) are largely seasonal and tend to spread more easily in winters rather than in the heat of the summer. We have no idea as of now whether COVID-19 will fall into this category. It could vanish altogether after the summer or  perhaps more likely scenario — it could appear again in another wave. We simply don’t know yet.
Is there a vaccine against it or a medicine I can take if I get infected?,"Yes, please refer this link : https://www.vaksincovid.gov.my/upload/media/What-Are-The-Types-Of-Vaccines-Eng.pdf to understand the 3 different vaccines available in Malaysia now."
Can I get the infection from eating say meat or by using products from China?,No not at all. First of all this is a virus that is being transmitted between humans through a respiratory route; just any animal you might encounter won’t harbour it. So eating meat has nothing to do with getting a coronavirus infection. Also viruses such as this one don’t last long on exposed surfaces and don’t tolerate high temperatures very well. The delays in a package reaching from China to India will ensure that no virus will survive the journey to infect you. It is thus safe to use products from China without fear of infection.
What is COVID-19,COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan China in December 2019.
What are the symptoms of COVID-19,The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever tiredness and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains nasal congestion runny nose sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually  Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment.Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing
Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air?,"COVID-19 transmits when people breathe in air contaminated by droplets and small airborne particles. The risk of breathing these in is highest when people are in close proximity, but they can be inhaled over longer distances, particularly indoors."
Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms?,The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low.However many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms.
Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease?,The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low  While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak The ongoing research on the waysCOVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings
What can I do to protect myself and prevent the spread of disease,1.Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an alcoholbased hand rub\nMaintain at least 1 metre (3 feet) distance between yourself andanyone who is coughing or sneezing\nAvoid touching eyes nose and mouth\n Make sure you and the people around you follow good respiratory hygiene. This means covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when you cough or sneeze\nStay home if you feel unwell\n Keep up to date on the latest COVID-19 hotspots (cities or local areas where COVID-19 is spreading widely).
How likely am I to catch COVID-19?,The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically whether there is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.
Should I worry about COVID-19?,Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild especially for children and young adults
Who is at risk of developing severe illness,While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (such as high blood pressure heart disease lung disease cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others.
Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?,No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses they only work on bacterial infections
Are there any medicines or therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19,"Scientists around the world are working to find and develop treatments for COVID-19.
Optimal supportive care includes oxygen for severely ill patients and those who are at risk for severe disease and more advanced respiratory support such as ventilation for patients who are critically ill.
Dexamethasone is a corticosteroid that can help reduce the length of time on a ventilator and save lives of patients with severe and critical illness.
WHO does not recommend self-medication with any medicines, including antibiotics, as a prevention or cure for COVID-19."
Is COVID-19 the same as SARS?,No. The virus that causes COVID-19 and the one that caused the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 are related to each other genetically
How long is the quarantine period for COVID-19?,The “quarantine incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days.
How long does the virus survive on surfaces?,Studies suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days
Is it safe to receive a package from any area where COVID-19 has been reported?,Yes. The likelihood of an infected person contaminating commercial goods is low and the risk of catching the virus that causes COVID-19 from a package that has been moved travlled and exposed to different conditions and temperature is also low. It is safer to sanitize however
Is there anything I should not do?,Smoking and  Wearing multiple masks and  Taking antibiotics.
How should i sanitize after coming home from outdoors?,"Thorough hand hygiene: washing hands with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand gel, should be performed before touching surfaces, items, pets, and people within the household environment. Please see: https://www.who.int/media/docs/default-source/integrated-health-services-(ihs)/infection-prevention-and-control/hand-hygiene-when-and-how-leaflet.pdf


While outside, people should always follow physical distancing measures, staying at least one metre from another person; perform hand hygiene by washing hands frequently with soap and water or using alcohol-based hand rub; follow good respiratory hygiene by covering your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue when coughing or sneezing; avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth; and avoid crowded places."
How to clean food items from outdoors?,"There is no evidence to date of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses being transmitted via food or food packaging. Coronaviruses cannot multiply in food; they need an animal or human host to multiply.

The COVID-19 virus is generally thought to be spread from person to person through respiratory droplets. Currently, there is no evidence to support transmission of the COVID-19 virus associated with food.

Before preparing or eating food it is important to always wash your hands with soap and water for at least 40-60 seconds. Regular food safety and handling guidance should be followed.
See: https://www.who.int/activities/promoting-safe-food-handling.

For food service businesses, please see the below guidance on COVID-19 and Food Safety: https://www.who.int/teams/risk-communication/food-and-agriculture-sectors. "
Can covid spread from breastfeeding?,"Transmission of active COVID-19 (virus that can cause infection) through breast milk and breastfeeding has not been detected to date. There is no reason to avoid or stop breastfeeding.

"
What exactly is contact tracing?,"Contact tracing identifies, and monitors people who have been exposed to someone who has been infected with SARS-CoV-2, and involves several steps : Indentifying contacts, Informing contacts,Managing and monitoring contacts and Data processes and analysis"
Booster shots for malaysians,Check here : https://vaksincovid.protecthealth.com.my/find
What vaccine is given for booster shot?,Pfizer.
What is a booster shot?,"A COVID booster shot is an additional dose of a vaccine given after the protection provided by the original shot(s) has begun to decrease over time. Typically, you would get a booster after the immunity from the initial dose(s) naturally starts to wane. The booster is designed to help people maintain their level of immunity for longer."
Covid variants,"Viruses constantly change through mutation. When a virus has one or more new mutations it’s called a variant of the original virus. Currently, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has identified two variants of the virus (SARS-CoV-2) that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) as variants of concern.

Delta (B.1.617.2). This variant is nearly twice as contagious as earlier variants and might cause more severe illness. The greatest risk of transmission is among unvaccinated people. People who are fully vaccinated can get vaccine breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others. However, it appears that vaccinated people spread COVID-19 for a shorter period than do unvaccinated people. While research suggests that COVID-19 vaccines are slightly less effective against the delta variant, the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Janssen/Johnson & Johnson COVID-19 vaccines still appear to provide protection against severe COVID-19.
Omicron (B.1.1.529). This variant might spread more easily than other variants, including delta. But it’s not yet clear if omicron causes more severe disease. It’s expected that people who are fully vaccinated likely can get breakthrough infections and spread the virus to others. However, the COVID-19 vaccines are expected to be effective at preventing severe illness. This variant also reduces the effectiveness of some monoclonal antibody treatments.
The alpha, gamma and beta variants continue to be monitored but are spreading at much lower levels in the U.S. The mu variant is also being monitored."
Am i at risk if i vape?,"E-cigarette use can expose the lungs to toxic chemicals, but whether those exposures increase the risk of COVID-19 or the severity of COVID-19 outcomes is not known. However, many e-cigarette users are current or former smokers, and cigarette smoking increases the risk of respiratory infections, including pneumonia."
Am i at risk if i smoke?,"Yes. Data shows that when compared to never smokers, cigarette smoking increases the risk of more severe illness from COVID-19, which could result in hospitalization, the need for intensive care, or even death. Smoking cigarettes can cause inflammation and cell damage throughout the body, and can weaken your immune system, making it less able to fight off disease."
Can pets carry covid?,"Although we know certain bacteria and fungi can be carried on fur and hair, there is no evidence that viruses, including the virus that causes COVID-19, can spread to people from the skin, fur, or hair of pets.

However, because animals can sometimes carry other germs that can make people sick, it’s always a good idea to practice healthy habits around pets and other animals, including washing hands before and after interacting with them and especially after cleaning up their waste.

Do not wipe or bathe your pet with chemical disinfectants, alcohol, hydrogen peroxide, or other products, such as hand sanitizer, counter-cleaning wipes, or other industrial or surface cleaners. If you have questions about appropriate products for bathing or cleaning your pet, talk to your veterinarian. If your pet gets hand sanitizer on their skin or fur, rinse or wipe down your pet with water immediately. If your pet ingests hand sanitizer (such as by chewing the bottle) or is showing signs of illness after use, contact your veterinarian or pet poison control immediately. "
Can we reuse disposable masks?,"The CDC does not recommend the reuse of disposable surgical masks that are intended to be used once. The FDA recognizes that there may be availability concerns with surgical masks during the COVID-19 public health emergency, but there are strategies to conserve surgical masks."
What does a positive COVID-19 Self-Test Result Mean?,"If you test positive, you should isolate and inform your healthcare provider, as well as any close
contacts. You do not need to get another test through a doctor or pharmacy.
• A positive self-test result means that the test detected the virus, and you are very likely
to have COVID-19.
• Stay home or isolate for five days, even if you are asymptomatic or your symptoms are
resolving.
• Wear a mask if you have contact with others.
• Avoid indoor gatherings to reduce the risk of spreading disease to someone else."
What does an inconclusive or invalid COVID-19 Self-Test Mean?,"If your home test is inconclusive, use the second test card and try again. If both are inconclusive,
then consider getting tested through your health care provider, a pharmacy, or at a community
sit"
How accurate are the iHealth COVID-19 self-tests?,"Based on the results of a clinical study where the iHealth® COVID-19 Antigen Rapid Test was
compared to an FDA authorized molecular SARS-CoV-2 test, iHealth® COVID-19 Antigen Rapid
Test correctly identified 94.3% of positive specimens and 98.1% of negative specimens."
How long do I need to be sick before I use the test kit?,"You can use self-tests, even when you are not sick. Consider using these self-tests before joining
indoor gatherings or activities with others who are not your close contacts."
"If I am vaccinated or unvaccinated, will the test still work?","Yes. You can use self-tests, regardless of vaccination sta"
Can COVID-19 be transmitted through food?,There is currently no evidence that people can catch COVID-19 from food. The virus that causes COVID-19 can be killed at temperatures similar to that of other known viruses and bacteria found in food
Can people with mild COVID-19 symptoms recover at home?,"People with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their symptoms at home. On average it takes 5–6 days from when someone is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can take up to 14 days."
